  abstract = {Model synthesis is a new approach to 3D modeling which automatically generates large models that resemble a small example model provided by the user. Model synthesis extends the 2D texture synthesis problem into higher dimensions and can be used to model many different objects and environments. The user only needs to provide an appropriate example model and does not need to provide any other instructions about how to generate the model. Model synthesis can be used to create symmetric models, models that change over time, and models that fit soft constraints. There are two important differences between our method and existing texture synthesis algorithms. The first is the use of a global search to find potential conflicts before adding new material to the model. The second difference is that we divide the problem of generating a large model into smaller subproblems which are easier to solve.},

  abstract = {There are few proposals to improve the interactivity and control of wave function collapse (WFC) in a mixed-initiative setting. Moreover, most WFC algorithm variants operate on an simple, unstructured set of tiles. This limitation on the level of control provided to designers hampers their creative work in various ways. We propose Hierarchical Semantic WFC, a generalized approach to WFC that organizes its tile-set into a hierarchy akin to a taxonomy induced by the relation ‘consists-of’. In such a hierarchical structure, abstract tiles (i.e.&nbsp;non-leaf nodes) can represent the first sketchy intentions of a designer (e.g.&nbsp;forest, urban, desert,...) This allows a designer to interactively collapse a given area into abstract tiles, while subsequently, (and repeatedly, if desired) WFC can resolve each area into a variety of particular instances, by further collapsing it into (a valid combination of) its children tiles (whether leaves or not). We identify how this subtle tile-set change affects the whole WFC algorithm, describe a number of novel exploratory and interactive functions that this enables, and showcase these with a variety of examples generated with our prototype implementation. We conclude that these new mixed-initiative content generation methods can considerably reduce design iteration times and improve the assistance given to designers in expressing their creative intent.},

  abstract = {Expressive range analysis is a visualization-based technique used to evaluate the performance of generative models, particularly in game level generation. It typically employs two quantifiable metrics to position generated artifacts on a 2D plot, offering insight into how content is distributed within a defined metric space. In this work, we use the expressive range of a generator as the conceptual space of possible creations. Inspired by the quality diversity paradigm, we explore this space to generate levels. To do so, we use a constraint-based generator that systematically traverses and generates levels in this space. To train the constraint-based generator we use different tile patterns to learn from the initial example levels. We analyze how different patterns influence the exploration of the expressive range. Specifically, we compare the exploration process based on time, the number of successful and failed sample generations, and the overall interestingness of the generated levels. Unlike typical quality diversity approaches that rely on random generation and hope to get good coverage of the expressive range, this approach systematically traverses the grid ensuring more coverage. This helps create unique and interesting game levels while also improving our understanding of the generator’s strengths and limitations.},

This paper explores the issues in creating a system that allows for rapid iteration in a turn-based user-LLM design software. We identify key research topics, including game world representation in LLMs, natural language-based world manipulation using function calls, and direct manipulation from processed LLM output. We successfully created a QA dataset to compare the accuracy of leading models using text, images, or both. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist in procedural content generation through enhanced natural language interaction and conversations while revealing the challenges of in-game world manipulation that warrant further research.},
